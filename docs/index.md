# Covid Gains - Project Name: Grosh

Grosh keeps track of all grocery related issues.  Grosh can track
the items a user buys based upon the user-input item list.  Grosh 
can keep track of weekly budget, this will help the user stay within the 
weekly budget for groceries.  The app can also calculate price of items 
after certain discount or sales tax.  The app will keep track of grocery
expirations, and suggest recipes with the ingredients set to expire before 
they expire.
